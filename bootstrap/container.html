            In HTML, the <div> tag is a block-level container element that 
            is mainly used to group other elements together. It does not add any visual effect on its own, 
            but it helps organize the structure of a webpage. 
            By grouping related content inside a <div>, developers
            or margins to the entire section at once, rather than styling each element individually.
            Without <div>, the webpage will still display content correctly,
            but it becomes difficult to manage layout and styling because each element has to be styled separately. 
            This makes the code harder to maintain, especially for large projects. In modern HTML5,
